## Transaction Bundle Upload

### Test Data

Generated 10,000 patients with Synthea master branch with Git SHA `4fed9eaf` and standard configuration using `./run_synthea -p 10000` resulting in 9.9 GiB of JSON files.

### Test System

The upload resulted in the following resource counts:

| Metric | Count |
| :--- | :--- |
| AllergyIntolerance | 5,360 |
| CarePlan | 35,578 |
| Claim | 522,122 |
| Condition | 83,683
| DiagnosticReport | 145,727 |
| Encounter | 408,512 |
| ExplanationOfBenefit | 408,512 |
| Goal | 27,125 |
| ImagingStudy | 8,122 |
| Immunization | 144,970 |
| MedicationAdministration | 6,120 |
| MedicationRequest | 113,610 |
| Observation | 2,072,024 |
| Organization | 33,718 |
| Patient | 11,674 |
| Practitioner | 33,714 |
| Procedure | 327,659 |
| **total** | **4,388,230** |

That are 4,388,230 resources in 33 minutes and 29 seconds or about 2,200 resources per second on a 8 core machine.

The size of the database directory after the import was 34 GiB and 8.4 GB after compaction.

### Other Test Systems

On a VM with 32 vCores the same upload with a concurrency of only 8 was 13 minutes and 12 seconds or about 5,500 resources per second. The VM was only utilized about 50% during the import.
