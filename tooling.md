# Tooling

## blazectl

Alongside Blaze, there is a command-line tool called blazectl which can be used to control a running Blaze instance. Currently the functionality of blazectl isn't specific to Blaze itself so it can also be used together with other FHIR® servers.

Blazectl is most suitable to upload transaction bundles to Blaze.

Download of the latest release: [blazectl v0.2.0](https://github.com/life-research/blazectl/releases/tag/v0.2.0)
