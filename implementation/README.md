# Implementation

## Threading Model

Blaze uses the [Aleph HTTP server](https://aleph.io/aleph/http.html) which is able to process requests asynchronously. Aleph doesn't need one thread per request processing. Instead it uses a low number of threads to handle I/O for multiple requests buffering HTTP headers and bodies. Once a request is fully received, a worker thread is used to calculate the response. In case the response calculation needs to perform I/O itself, like connecting to the Datomic transactor for writes, it uses [Manifold Deferreds](https://aleph.io/manifold/deferreds.html) to do that asynchronously as well. Doing so makes all other request processing CPU bound.

For transactions, Blaze has to do I/O. The transaction data is send to the Datomic transactor and Blaze has to wait for the answer. In order to maximize the throughput of the transactor, Blaze uses a parallelism level of 20 while sending data to it. Again a work-stealing thread pool is used to achieve and maintain that parallelism level.

## Database Design

There exists a separate page for implementation considerations regarding the database design.

{% page-ref page="../database-design.md" %}

## History Paging

For histories, the resources are taken from transactions using the `:tx/resources` attribute. The first resource of a page can be adressed by a combination of transaction and the resource itself because a resource can't be changed two times within one transaction. The transaction will be addressed by its `t` and the resource by its `eid`. The query params are `page-t` and `page-eid`, although they aren't public. On top of that a query param `t` is also used in order to mark the database for `Bundle.total`.
